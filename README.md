## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

There are a lot of repositories on GitHub, but I didn't find a bot convenient for me. So I decided to make and improve the code for other programmers. Subsequently, this bot will be needed for artists who want to see the primary colors.

Of course, I will improve and support this bot. You can help me by writing to me and I will give you my banking details. You can also open a new branch and send a request under an error or an open question.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Built With

* Aiogram

* Pillow
* Python-dotenv
